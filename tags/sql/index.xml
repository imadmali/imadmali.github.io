      <description>So recently I ran into a bit of a snafu. I wanted to do some SQL prototyping (with postgres) on my local machine but didn&amp;rsquo;t have the appropriate permissions to install and mess around with it. The postgres Docker image really came in handy. Below are some notes about what I did to get up and running with postgres in Docker. I thought they might come in handy to a Data Scientist or Machine Learning engineer facing a similar situation.</description>

      <title>SQL Concepts</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a non-exhaustive laundry list of SQL concepts that I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful. You could think of them as intermediate? advanced? concepts that anyone doing data science or machine learning should probably know. I tried to order the concepts list is loosely in order of complexity, however that may vary from person to person.
All the examples here are done using the postgres Docker image available here (I talk about how to work with a postgres container in a separate post).</description>
