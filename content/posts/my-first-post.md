## 1.21 Gigawatts!

Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Never? I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Huh?

My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Marty, you made it. Are you sure about this storm?

The storm. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Well, I figured, what the hell. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.

```python
def foo():
  result = "wabalabadub"
  return(result + " dub")
```
