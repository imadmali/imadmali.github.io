## Great Scott

Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. The storm.

My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. I will. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Marty you gotta come back with me. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.

What's the meaning of this. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.

### She's Your Mother!?

Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Thank you. In about thirty years. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Ahh.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious reprocautions on future events. Do you understand?

## Roads, Where We're Going we Don't Need Roads

Never? Safe now, everything's let lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? What did your mother ever see in that kid? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.

It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.

Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Huh? Ahh. Ahh. Maybe you were adopted.
