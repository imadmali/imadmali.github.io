                <p>Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;blogging&rdquo;&hellip; depends on your definition. I did a pretty bad job of regularly posting what I was writing. Ok, to be brutally honest I didn&rsquo;t actually post any of what I wrote until the new year. But I did regularly write and collect my thoughts throughout 2020 (thanks to <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> for making it so easy). That&rsquo;s the important part, right?</p>
<p>The whole process was incredibly invaluable. Writing did two things for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>It forced me to finish each thought so I&rsquo;m not walking around with half baked ideas sounding like an moron. (To be clear, it hasn&rsquo;t <em>stopped</em> me from sounding like a moron.)</li>
<li>It freed up space in my brain for new ideas and things to think about.</li>
</ol>
<p>Abstracting these two, I guess it was just generally cathartic. It didn&rsquo;t come without it&rsquo;s frustrations though. I&rsquo;m seem to be one of those people who generates ideas faster than implementing them. And it was irritating to have a massive list of unfinished thoughts. But I guess it&rsquo;s better to have backlog than to have things lost in the depths of my brain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to a strong second year of active blogging. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll post more regularly and not in massive batch updates ;)</p>
